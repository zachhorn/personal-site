                        Building <a href="https://archived.capital" target="_blank">Archived Capital</a> is consuming a large portion of my time. I created it because I couldn't find enough good information on the study of mental models, and specifically how a person develops in the internal architecture of their intellect. How are memories formed and retrieved? How does one store information so that it is useful and accessible? How does a person improve reading recall and retention? These things are interesting to me, so I'd like to invest my time into building a resource that seeks to gather information on these topics.

                        Working on the idea that there is an arbitrage between the moment someone wants (or needs) to sell a piece of furniture and the price a person would pay for that same piece of furniture. Delivery and pickup are value adds. You would be offering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity" target="_blank">liquidity</a> in a relatively illiquid market. I have first-hand experience with this market: People will throw away good furniture ($5,000 sofas, moderate use), because they don't want to go through the hassle of selling it.
