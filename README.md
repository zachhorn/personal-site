Welcome, this is my personal site.

## CHANGELOG

### v5.5 - July 2019
- Working towards the goal of implementing a more structured web app experience. i.e. Either a db or a flat-file cms, which would let me write posts in markdown while the site would compile and build at runtime.
- There are many imperfect solutions on the market currently, so I'm spending some time with each to get a feel for which would be best for the long term.
- I'm doing this so I have a place to host my personal writing, essays, daily blog, etc. I also want to start an seo effort for 'Zach Horn', so I can rank for my own name. There are a few other people with my name and a professional presence â€” so, challenge accepted.

### v5.0 - May 20, 2019
- Redesigned site
- Light theme
- vector logo
- better content alignment
- cleaned up html structure

### v4.5 - March 15, 2019
- Updated all text in sections
- Added @supreact twitter tl embed
- Updated now page


### v4.0 - 2019 Redesign - Jan 15, 2019
- Dark theme
- Full name signature logo, which replaces the initials
- changed link color to a lighter blue, with the a:hover state a medium accent red
- changed h2 font to Contrail One, a more kinetic font which modernizes the look and feel of the site.
- Added Super Reactor's current updates, and removed Archived Capital (which is now essentially a part of Super Reactor)

### v3.0

- Changed the site header from text to a .png of my initials. Looks better.
- Changed sitewide fonts to Roboto, and optimized for legibility.
- Improved readability via wider line-height.
- Added a /now page to track broad changes in my work life. 
- Changed link colors to a more traditional blue w/o underline, which looks cleaner and makes the site easier to use.
- Added sitemap.xml, and verified the site with Google Search Console.

### v2.0

- Need to lock down boilerplate HTML, or create some kind of theme, so that I can add more pages easily. 

### v1.0 - June 2018

- First (rough) version of the base HTML/CSS.
- Very basic, probably needs to be cleaned up, rearranged, and brought in line with current best practices.
