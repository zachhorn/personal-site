# zacheh.com

This is my personal site. It serves as a overview of where I'm investing my time.

I recently added a /now page, an idea from Derek Sivers.

## CHANGELOG

### v3.0

- Changed the site header from text to a .png of my initials. Looks better.
- Changed sitewide fonts to Roboto, and optimized for legibility.
- Improved readability via wider line-height.
- Added a /now page to track broad changes in my work life. 
- Changed link colors to a more traditional blue w/o underline, which looks cleaner and makes the site easier to use.
- Added sitemap.xml, and verified the site with Google Search Console.

### v2.0

- Need to lock down boilerplate HTML, so that I can add more pages easily. 

### v1.0

- First (rough) version of the base HTML/CSS.
- Very basic, probably needs to be cleaned up, rearranged, and brought in line with current best practices. Might need outside help/consultation. 
- Takeaways:
	- I know what I know.
	- I'm beginning to comprehend the scale of what I don't know.
