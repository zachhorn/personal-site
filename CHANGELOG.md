# CHANGELOG

## v2.0

- Need to lock down boilerplate HTML, so that I can add more pages easily. 

## v1.0

- First (rough) version of the base HTML/CSS.
- Very basic, probably needs to be cleaned up, rearranged, and brought in line with current best practices. Might need outside help/consultation. 
- Takeaways:
	- I know what I know.
	- I'm beginning to comprehend the scale of what I don't know.
